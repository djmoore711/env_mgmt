# WIP
I am setting out to create a utility that will make managing environments easier. I would like to develop a command-line utility that simplifies creating, modifying, deleting, and disabling Python environments, eliminating the need to remember all the different commands that you only run periodically.

TO-DO List for Project
[ ] Figure out exactly what workflows I want this application to handle
[ ] Consider activities such as create, modify, delete, and disable Python environments
[ ] Consider the ability to activate and deactivate Python environments
